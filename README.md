# GjigsAI
A text generation AI in Java

> **What is this?**

This is a generational AI that can generate whatever you want, as long as your dataset is parsed correctly

> **How does this work?**

The AI retrieves a dataset from your input and parses it by using the parsing character that you gave it. After that, it finds the closest thing in the dataset to the input and then adds it to the output where it is funneled back into the input. To prevent **SOME** repeating phrases like this like this like this, the AI has some randomness implemented to sometimes use the second best answer.

> **Speed**

The speed of the AI depends on the size of the dataset, the bigger the dataset the slower.
